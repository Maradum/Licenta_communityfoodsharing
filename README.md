## Build for Production

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

To start the production server:

```bash
npm start
```

## Deployment to Vercel

### Environment Variables

When deploying to Vercel, you need to set:

- `DATABASE_URL`: Your MySQL database connection string (from Railway)
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JWT token generation

### Database

This application uses a MySQL database hosted on Railway. The database connection is configured using Sequelize ORM.

Database tables are automatically created on first connection if they don't exist (using `sequelize.sync()`).

### Build Configuration

The application is configured to ignore ESLint and TypeScript errors during build, which ensures successful deployment even if there are linting issues.

### Dependency Resolution

The project includes an override for `react-speech-kit` to resolve compatibility issues with React 19. This is handled in the package.json file with:

```json
"overrides": {
  "react-speech-kit": {
    "react": "$react"
  }
}
```

Additionally, an `.npmrc` file with `legacy-peer-deps=true` is included to ensure proper dependency resolution.
